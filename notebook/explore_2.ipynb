But the good news is I still qualify for a student eurail pass, which saves us $143.45. But I also think my emergency fund is unrealistic at $100, I should make it $150. So, with the 768 dollars I have from grandma's trust fund, plus the 800 you guys are already giving me, I will need another 229 dollars and eleven cents.
